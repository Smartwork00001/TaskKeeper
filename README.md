# ToDoApp

1. A trick I learned after struggling for a whole day with dividing the code into modules. To divide the code into modules, one way is to write the code as you normally would if you had to write it in one file, and those parts that are too long, put them in a separate module.

2. const projects = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("projects")) || []; because I was getting null;

3)When thinking of HTML it is best to have a template ready in the index.html and apply hidden aka display = "none" and remove hidden class when needed. The values may be added later through javascript.
